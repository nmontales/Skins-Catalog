                Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter video game that has garnered a massive following since its initial release in 1999. 
                Developed as a mod for Half-Life, it quickly evolved into a standalone game. The gameplay focuses on two opposing teams, the 
                Terrorists and the Counter-Terrorists, engaging in various objective-based scenarios, including bomb planting/defusal and 
                hostage rescue. Players select from a variety of weapons and equipment at the beginning of each round, using strategy, teamwork,
                and individual skill to outmaneuver and defeat their opponents. The game is renowned for its competitive scene, featuring
                numerous tournaments and leagues worldwide, and has seen several updates and iterations, including the popular Counter-Strike:
                Global Offensive (CSGO). In 2013, CSGO recieved an update titled the armsdeal update which introduced skins as an addition to the
                game. Eleven years later and with the release of CS2, skins have garnered their own market valueing into the millions of dollars.

            <h1> Why are some skins so expensive? </h1>
            <p>
                Skins in Counter Strike have gotten to the prices they are because of how they are obtained. A majority of skins are recieved 
                by opening cases that are recieved by playing the game or by buying the case from the steam market. Once you open the case you 
                have a chance at getting a skin with differing rarity. The rarest gun skin being the coverts marked with the color red, and the 
                the rarest items you can get from the cases are knives that have a 1 in 400 chance to drop. Each opening is random so even if you 
                statistically have those odds at opening a knife you can open thousands of cases and never open one.

            <p>
                Once getting a skin there are still more factors that the price takes into account. Each skin has a wear rating and pattern 
                index. Each weapon skin has an associated pattern template, and the pattern index dictates how this template is applied to a 
                specific weapon. This can affect the positioning, rotation, and scale of the pattern on the weapon, resulting in visually 
                distinct apearances even among weapons of the same skin type.The wear rating of the skin determines how clean the skin is 
                gonna look. Factory new means that its the best rating, then it goes to minimal wear, field-tested, well-worn, and battle-scared. 
                The rating depends on a numerical value called float, the lower the float the better the rating. The pattern index and wear value 
                together significantly affect a skin's aesthetics and, by extension, it's market value.
